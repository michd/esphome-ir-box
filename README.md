# ESPHome IR Box

A device mainly intended to tie A/C units that are controlled by infrared remote control into Home Assistant, by running esphome on it and having an IR LED and receiver.

It can also control other IR devices within line of sight, of course; TVs, remote controlled RGB LED bulbs come to mind.

This project is derived from one where I use an identical esp32 dev board as a WLED controller. This has different supporting hardware, though.
